       nxt_unit_response_send - send response in Unit app

[1mLibrary[0m
       NGINX Unit library ([4mlibunit[24m, [4m‚Äêlunit[24m)

[1mSynopsis[0m
       [1m#include <nxt_unit.h>[0m

       [1mint nxt_unit_response_send(nxt_unit_request_info_t *[4m[22mreq[24m[1m);[0m

[1mArguments[0m
       [4mreq[24m    Request object.

[1mDescription[0m
       [4mnxt_unit_response_send[24m(3)  sends a response to a request.  The response
       should have been previously crafted with [4mnxt_unit_response_add_field[24m(3)
       and [4mnxt_unit_response_add_content[24m(3).

       If the [1mContent‚Äêlength [22mheader field is not present in the response, Unit
       will automatically add a [1mTransfer‚ÄêEncoding: chunked  [22mheader.   In  that
       case, it is possible to call this function several times, and Unit will
       use chunks as appropriate for the contents.

       This function tells [4munitd[24m(8) that the response is ready to be sent, and
       puts it in the send queue.  It doesn‚Äôt really send it, and it may merge
       several  response  chunks  into  a single one if they accumulate in the
       buffer.

       When the response has been completely  sent,  [4mnxt_unit_response_done[24m(3)
       should be called.

[1mReturn value[0m
       0 on success, or a non‚Äêzero error code on error.

[1mErrors[0m
       Errors will be reported in the Unit debug log.

       [1mNXT_UNIT_ERROR[0m
              ‚Ä¢  Response not initialized yet.
              ‚Ä¢  Response already sent.

[1mExamples[0m
