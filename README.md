# NGINX Unit

## Universal Web App Server

![NGINX Unit Logo](docs/unitlogo.svg)

NGINX Unit is a lightweight and versatile open-source server that has
three core capabilities:

- acts as an HTTP reverse proxy,
- serves static media assets,
- runs application code in seven languages.

Unit compresses several layers of the modern application stack into a potent,
coherent solution with a focus on performance, low latency, and scalability. It
is intended as a universal building block for any web architecture regardless
of its complexity, from enterprise-scale deployments to your pet's homepage.

Its native RESTful JSON API enables dynamic updates with zero interruptions
and flexible configuration, while its out-of-the-box productivity reliably
scales to production-grade workloads. We achieve that with a complex,
asynchronous, multithreading architecture comprising multiple processes to
ensure security and robustness while getting the most out of today's computing
platforms.

## Running a Hello World App

Suppose you saved a PHP script as `/www/helloworld/index.php`:
``` php
<?php echo "Hello, PHP on Unit!"; ?>
```

To run it on Unit with the `unit-php` module installed, first set up an
application object. Let's store our first config snippet in a file called
`config.json`:

``` json
{
    "helloworld": {
        "type": "php",
        "root": "/www/helloworld/"
    }
}
```

Saving it as a file isn't necessary, but can come in handy with larger objects.

But, before proceeding, make sure that you take note of the unix socket that the 
controller listens on, by executing:
``` console
# unitd --version
```

You want to replace `/path/to/control.unit.sock` in the following scripts by the value
returned in ```--control=unix:``` .

Now, `PUT` it into the `/config/applications` section of Unit's control API,
usually available by default via a Unix domain socket:

``` console
# curl -X PUT --data-binary @config.json --unix-socket  \
       /path/to/control.unit.sock http://localhost/config/applications
```
``` json

{
	"success": "Reconfiguration done."
}
```

Next, reference the app from a listener object in the `/config/listeners`
section of the API.  This time, we pass the config snippet straight from the
command line:

``` console
# curl -X PUT -d '{"127.0.0.1:8080": {"pass": "applications/helloworld"}}'  \
       --unix-socket /path/to/control.unit.sock http://localhost/config/listeners
```
``` json
{
    "success": "Reconfiguration done."
}
```

Now Unit accepts requests at the specified IP and port, passing them to the
application process. Your app works!

``` console
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080

      Hello, PHP on Unit!
```

Finally, query the entire `/config` section of the control API:

``` console
# curl --unix-socket /path/to/control.unit.sock http://localhost/config/
```

Unit's output should contain both snippets, neatly organized:

``` json
{
    "listeners": {
        "127.0.0.1:8080": {
            "pass": "applications/helloworld"
        }
    },

    "applications": {
        "helloworld": {
            "type": "php",
            "root": "/www/helloworld/"
        }
    }
}
```
